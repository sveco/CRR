  Console Feed Reader

  Big thanks to awesome newsbeuter team for inspiration. This app is built from scratch, and do not use any portion
  of newsbeuter code. This is open source project to provide windows users with purely textual Atom and RSS feed reader.

Full documentation coming soon - after the app is ready for actual usage, current state is early beta.
